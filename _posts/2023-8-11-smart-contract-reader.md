<br>`ERC20 Faucet React Project with Thirdweb Framework`

This repository contains the source code for a project written with React and Thirdweb framework. 

The project is hosted on GitHub Pages under my private domain.

<br> `Overview`

The project is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

It utilizes the Thirdweb framework to interact with smart contracts, enabling seamless integration with blockchain functionalities.

<br> `Requirements`

To interact with this project, you'll need to have a MetaMask wallet installed on your browser. 

MetaMask is a popular Ethereum wallet extension that allows you to manage your Ethereum accounts and interact with blockchain applications.

<br> **`Important Notes`**

This project's ERC20 contract lives on the `Ethereum Testnet blockchain Mumbai`. 

While the contract is considered safe for use, I recommend being cautious and not interacting with other contracts until all potential bugs are corrected.

<br> `Features`

* Uses hooks and custom CSS to render a modern and user-friendly UI.

* Uses hooks and custom CSS to render a modern and user-friendly UI.
* Utilizes Thirdweb framework to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum Test blockchain.
* Custom-written ERC20 contract implementation for token functionality.
* Enable interaction with my ERC-20 implementation, though other token contracts may also be used.
* Developed with React, leveraging React hooks and custom CSS for user-friendly UI rendering.
